Here are the features I want the TODO app to have:
- Specify the file to store tasks. A default file should be used if the user doesn't specify one. The default location should be in the user's home directory.
- Show a menu.
- Add new tasks.
- Remove tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Mark tasks as uncompleted.
- Set a priority level for tasks (e.g., low, medium, high).
- Add optional logging.
